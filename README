Head Tracking with a Webcam

Demo:
https://youtu.be/HPvZFophK_A

Introduction:
The program headtrack shows a video stream from your webcam 
in a window and draws a box around the detected head. Then
the head position in front of the screen is estimated. The
view direction is deduced assuming that the viewer is looking
at the screen. A datagram server provides head position and 
view direction. This data can be used by external applications
to control the user view.

Prerequisites:
You need OpenCV (tested with versions 2.4) installed.

Installation:
Please read the INSTALL file.
