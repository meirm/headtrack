Head Tracking with a Webcam

The program headtrack shows a video stream from your webcam 
in a window and draws a box around the detected head. Then
the head position in front of the screen is estimated. The
view direction is deduced assuming that the viewer is looking
at the screen. A datagram server provides head position and 
view direction. This data can be used by external applications
to control the user view.

You need OpenCV (tested with versions 2.4) installed.

1. Type 'make install' to compile the program headtrack and 
   install it to /usr/bin/headtrack

2. Type 'headtrack' to run the program


(or use 'make installdeb' to create and install deb package)
